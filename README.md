# DNS Prefer IPv4

This is the very badly written DNS server that allows me to use my faster home IPv4 connection instead of my ISP-throttled IPv6 tunnel unless a website is IPv6-only. While this is possible by changing OS-level settings, I wanted something that could apply to my whole network without the need to manually change settings on each device.
